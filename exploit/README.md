## Useful links

[Ruby install link](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-ruby-on-rails-with-rbenv-on-ubuntu-20-04) - Highly recommended to use the `rbenv` if you need to do anything with Ruby

## Instructions:
1. Need to install the Metasploit using the above link provided. Highly recommended to clean up the installation of `Ruby` with `rbenv`.
2. `docker run -it -p 80:80 --rm --name base-nginx-1.4.0-32 polyverse/vuln 
erable-nginx-1.4.0:base` (This will run the Docker container containing the nginx-1.4.0)
3. `docker exec -it base-nginx-1.4.0-32 /bin/bash` this will allow you to hook into executing container
4. `ps aux` will show the nginx running and `/opt/bin/gdb -p 1` will hook the process (PID) onto the gdb, where now it is possible to run `continue`
