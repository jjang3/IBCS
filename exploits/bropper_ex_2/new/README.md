This is assuming the ibcs.new is created in $HOME/IBCS/results/bropper_ex_2

`bash build.sh` will build the docker container

`docker run -it -p 1337:1337 bropper:ex_2_new`

If port issues occur, it may be because the command `lsof -t -i:1337` didnâ€™t detect this because lsof typically shows host-level processes, while Docker containers may not be directly visible in the same way unless inspected specifically.
